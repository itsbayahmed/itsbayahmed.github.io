# Ahmed's Second Brain 🧠
Welcome to my personal knowledge base. Here I document my Linux journey and coding studies. From system setups, new things I've learned recently, to notes from my courses and some tips and tricks useful for everyone. This is a **work-in-progress (WIP)** blog for my journey to become a **Back-End Developer**, so I may add, remove or edit things here as I progress on my journey.
